**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Implement the new theme color palette.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has changed the color palette multiple times based on user requests, most recently by updating CSS variables in  and hardcoded TailwindCSS classes across various components.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        -   Analyze the user request: sky blue, black, white, blue. This is ambiguous. Use the  tool to clarify which color is for primary buttons, text, background, etc.
        -   Alternatively, use the  component created earlier. Check if it's functional. If not, fix it and use it to apply the new theme. This would be a more robust solution than find-and-replace.
        -   Update  with the new color variables.
        -   Search for hardcoded color classes (e.g., , ) in all  files and replace them with the new theme variables/classes.

    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent previously made the menu background solid white and adjusted its size. However, the user states it's still too big and the word is not clear.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        -   Review .
        -   Reduce the font size and padding within the mobile menu container.
        -   Ensure the background color has high contrast with the text color (as per the new theme).

-   **Task 1: Theme and UI Overhaul (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Start by implementing the sky blue, black, white, blue theme (Issue 1).
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A visually updated website that matches the user's latest request.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**

    -   **P2: Integrate the logo image:** The user uploaded a logo. The agent changed the brand name in text but needs to integrate the actual image file () into the  component.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: WhatsApp notification for order details:** The user confirmed they want order details sent via WhatsApp. Currently, the WhatsApp number is only used for login. This requires a third-party integration (e.g., Twilio). Use .
    -   **P3: Admin UI for managing shipping fees:** Currently, the shipping fee is hardcoded. A future improvement would be to allow the admin to manage this from the dashboard.
